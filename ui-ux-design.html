            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In this module, I delved into the world of UI/UX Design for apps, which proved to be a fascinating and engaging 
                experience. Using Figma as my primary tool, I learned to create interactive prototypes and design user-friendly 
                interfaces. The process of crafting intuitive user experiences captivated me, sparking a genuine interest in this field.
                 Motivated by this newfound passion, I dedicated myself to regular practice, consistently using Figma to refine my 
                 skills. Through this hands-on approach, I noticed a significant improvement in my design perspective. I began to 
                 understand the nuances of user-centered design, the importance of visual hierarchy, and how to create interfaces that 
                 are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also sharpened 
                 my ability to think from a user's point of view, making me more adept at creating designs that truly resonate with 
                 end-users.</p>
