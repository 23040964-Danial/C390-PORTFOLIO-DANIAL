            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, I embarked on my first journey into fundamentals of design using Adobe Illustrator to create 
                concept sketches for the website's layout. As a beginner, I initially struggled with understanding design principles 
                and found the process challenging. Through persistent practice and learning, I gradually developed skills in 
                planning the structure, balance, and hierarchy of elements. This project was a crucial learning experience that 
                helped me improve my design capabilities, teaching me how to enhance usability and visual appeal step by step. I 
                learned that design is an iterative process, and my first attempts were far from perfect, but each iteration brought 
                me closer to creating a more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing layout.</p>
